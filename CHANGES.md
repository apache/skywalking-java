  and CVE-2021-21409.
* Upgrade consul client caused by CVE-2018-1000844, CVE-2018-1000850.
* Upgrade zookeeper caused by CVE-2019-0201, zookeeper cluster coordinator plugin now requires zookeeper server 3.5+.
* Upgrade snake yaml caused by CVE-2017-18640.
* Upgrade embed tomcat caused by CVE-2020-13935.
* Upgrade commons-lang3 to avoid potential NPE in some JDK versions.
* OAL supports generating metrics from events.
* Support endpoint name grouping by OpenAPI definitions.
* Concurrent create PrepareRequest when persist Metrics
* Fix CounterWindow increase computing issue.
* Performance: optimize Envoy ALS analyzer performance in high traffic load scenario (reduce ~1cpu in ~10k RPS).
* Performance: trim useless metadata fields in Envoy ALS metadata to improve performance.
* Fix: slowDBAccessThreshold dynamic config error when not configured.
* Performance: cache regex pattern and result, optimize string concatenation in Envy ALS analyzer.
* Performance: cache metrics id and entity id in `Metrics` and `ISource`.
* Performance: enhance persistent session mechanism, about differentiating cache timeout for different dimensionality
  metrics. The timeout of the cache for minute and hour level metrics has been prolonged to ~5 min.
* Performance: Add L1 aggregation flush period, which reduce the CPU load and help young GC.
* Support connectTimeout and socketTimeout settings for ElasticSearch6 and ElasticSearch7 storages.
* Re-implement storage session mechanism, cached metrics are removed only according to their last access timestamp,
  rather than first time. This makes sure hot data never gets removed unexpectedly.
* Support session expired threshold configurable.
* Fix InfluxDB storage-plugin Metrics#multiGet issue.
* Replace zuul proxy with spring cloud gateway 2.x. in webapp module.
* Upgrade etcd cluster coordinator and dynamic configuration to v3.x.
* Configuration: Allow configuring server maximum request header size.
* Add thread state metric and class loaded info metric to JVMMetric.
* Performance: compile LAL DSL statically and run with type checked.
* Add pagination to event query protocol.
* Performance: optimize Envoy error logs persistence performance.
* Support envoy `cluster manager` metrics.
* Performance: remove the synchronous persistence mechanism from batch ElasticSearch DAO. Because the current enhanced
  persistent session mechanism, don't require the data queryable immediately after the insert and update anymore.
* Performance: share `flushInterval` setting for both metrics and record data, due
  to `synchronous persistence mechanism` removed. Record flush interval used to be hardcoded as 10s.
* Remove `syncBulkActions` in ElasticSearch storage option.
* Increase the default bulkActions(env, SW_STORAGE_ES_BULK_ACTIONS) to 5000(from 1000).
* Increase the flush interval of ElasticSearch indices to 15s(from 10s)
* Provide distinct for elements of metadata lists. Due to the more aggressive asynchronous flush, metadata lists have
  more chances including duplicate elements. Don't need this as indicate anymore.
* Reduce the flush period of hour and day level metrics, only run in 4 times of regular persistent period. This means
  default flush period of hour and day level metrics are 25s * 4.
* Performance: optimize IDs read of ElasticSearch storage options(6 and 7). Use the physical index rather than template
  alias name.
* Adjust index refresh period as INT(flushInterval * 2/3), it used to be as same as bulk flush period. At the edge case,
  in low traffic(traffic < bulkActions in the whole period), there is a possible case, 2 period bulks are included in
  one index refresh rebuild operation, which could cause version conflicts. And this case can't be fixed
  through `core/persistentPeriod` as the bulk fresh is not controlled by the persistent timer anymore.
* The `core/maxSyncOperationNum` setting(added in 8.5.0) is removed due to metrics persistence is fully asynchronous.
* The `core/syncThreads` setting(added in 8.5.0) is removed due to metrics persistence is fully asynchronous.
* Optimization: Concurrency mode of execution stage for metrics is removed(added in 8.5.0). Only concurrency of prepare
  stage is meaningful and kept.
* Fix `-meters` metrics topic isn't created with namespace issue
* Enhance persistent session timeout mechanism. Because the enhanced session could cache the metadata metrics forever,
  new timeout mechanism is designed for avoiding this specific case.
* Fix Kafka transport topics are created duplicated with and without namespace issue
* Fix the persistent session timeout mechanism bug.
* Fix possible version_conflict_engine_exception in bulk execution.
* Fix PrometheusMetricConverter may throw an `IllegalArgumentException` when convert metrics to SampleFamily
* Filtering NaN value samples when build SampleFamily  

#### UI

* Fix the date component for log conditions.
* Fix selector keys for duplicate options.
* Add Python celery plugin.
* Fix default config for metrics.
* Fix trace table for profile ui.
* Fix the error of server response time in the topology.
* Fix chart types for setting metrics configure.

#### Documentation

* Add FAQ about `Elasticsearch exception type=version_conflict_engine_exception since 8.7.0`
* Add Self Observability service discovery (k8s).

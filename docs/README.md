# Welcome
**Here are SkyWalking 8 official documentation. You're welcome to join us.**

From here you can learn all about **SkyWalking**’s architecture, how to deploy and use SkyWalking, and develop based on SkyWalking contributions guidelines.

**NOTICE, SkyWalking 8 uses brand new tracing APIs, it is incompatible with all previous releases.**

- [Concepts and Designs](en/concepts-and-designs/README.md). You'll find the the most important core ideas about SkyWalking. You can learn from here if you want to understand what is going on under our cool features and visualization.

- [Setup](en/setup/README.md). Guides for installing SkyWalking in different scenarios. As a platform, it provides several ways of the observability.

- [UI Introduction](en/ui/README.md). Introduce the UI usage and features. 

- [Contributing Guides](en/guides/README.md). Guides are for PMC member, committer or new contributor. Here, you can find how to start contributing.

- [Protocols](en/protocols/README.md). Protocols show the communication ways between agents/probes and backend. Anyone interested in uplink telemetry data should definitely read this.

- [FAQs](en/FAQ/README.md). A manifest of already known setup problems, secondary developments experiments. When you are facing a problem, check here first.


In addition, you might find these links interesting:

- The latest and old releases are all available at [Apache SkyWalking release page](http://skywalking.apache.org/downloads/). The change logs are [here](../CHANGES.md).

      * [Choose storage](en/setup/backend/backend-storage.md). As we know, in default quick start, backend is running with H2 DB. But clearly, it doesn't fit the product env. In here, you could find what other choices do you have. Choose the one you like, we also welcome anyone to contribute new storage implementors.
      * [Set receivers](en/setup/backend/backend-receivers.md). You could choose receivers by your requirements, most receivers are harmless, at least our default receivers are. You would set and active all receivers provided.
      * [Open fetchers](en/setup/backend/backend-fetcher.md). You could open different fetchers to read metrics from the target applications. These ones work like receivers, but in pulling mode, typically like Prometheus.
      * Do [trace sampling](en/setup/backend/trace-sampling.md) at backend. Trace sampling allows you to keep your metrics accurate, whilst only keeping some traces in storage based on rate.
      * Follow [slow DB statement threshold](en/setup/backend/slow-db-statement.md) config document to understand how to detect slow database statements (including SQL statements) in your system.
      * Official [OAL scripts](en/guides/backend-oal-scripts.md). As you known from our [OAL introduction](en/concepts-and-designs/oal.md), most of backend analysis capabilities based on the scripts. Here is the description of official scripts, which helps you to understand which metrics data are in process, also could be used in alarm.
      * [Alarm](en/setup/backend/backend-alarm.md). Alarm provides a time-series based check mechanism. You could set alarm rules targeting the analysis oal metrics objects.
      * [Advanced deployment options](en/setup/backend/advanced-deployment.md). If you want to deploy backend in very large scale and support high loads, you may need this.
      * [Metrics exporter](en/setup/backend/metrics-exporter.md). Use metrics data exporter to forward metrics data to 3rd party systems.
      * [Time To Live (TTL)](en/setup/backend/ttl.md). Metrics and traces are time series data, they would be saved forever, you could set the expired time for each dimension.
      * [Dynamic Configuration](en/setup/backend/dynamic-config.md). Make configuration of OAP changed dynamic, from remote service or 3rd party configuration management system.
      * [Uninstrumented Gateways](en/setup/backend/uninstrumented-gateways.md). Configure gateways/proxies that are not supported by SkyWalking agent plugins, to reflect the delegation in topology graph.
      * [Apdex threshold](en/setup/backend/apdex-threshold.md). Configure the thresholds for different services if Apdex calculation is activated in the OAL.
      * [Service Grouping](en/setup/backend/service-auto-grouping.md). An automatic grouping mechanism for all services based on name.

# Overview
SkyWalking is an open source observability platform used to collect, analyze, aggregate and visualize data from services and cloud native
infrastructures. SkyWalking provides an easy way to maintain a clear view of your distributed systems, even across Clouds.
It is a modern APM, specially designed for cloud native, container based distributed systems.

## Why use SkyWalking?
SkyWalking provides solutions for observing and monitoring distributed systems, in many different scenarios. First of all,
like traditional approaches, SkyWalking provides auto instrument agents for services, such as Java, C#, Node.js, Go, PHP and Nginx LUA. 
(with calls out for Python and C++ SDK contributions). 
In multi-language, continuously deployed environments, cloud native infrastructures grow more powerful but also more complex. 
SkyWalking's service mesh receiver allows SkyWalking to receive telemetry data from service mesh frameworks
such as Istio/Envoy and Linkerd, allowing users to understand the entire distributed system.

SkyWalking provides observability capabilities for **service**(s), **service instance**(s), **endpoint**(s). The terms Service,
Instance and Endpoint are used everywhere today, so it is worth defining their specific meanings in the context of SkyWalking:

- **Service**. Represents a set/group of workloads which provide the same behaviours for incoming requests. You can define the service
  name when you are using instrument agents or SDKs. SkyWalking can also use the name you define in platforms such as Istio.
- **Service Instance**. Each individual workload in the Service group is known as an instance. Like `pods` in Kubernetes, it 
  doesn't need to be a single OS process, however, if you are using instrument agents, an instance is actually a real OS process.
- **Endpoint**. A path in a service for incoming requests, such as an HTTP URI path or a gRPC service class + method signature. 

SkyWalking allows users to understand the topology relationship between Services and Endpoints, to view the metrics of every 
Service/Service Instance/Endpoint and to set alarm rules.

In addition, you can integrate 
1. Other distributed tracing using SkyWalking native agents and SDKs with Zipkin, Jaeger and OpenCensus.
1. Other metrics systems, such as Prometheus, Sleuth(Micrometer), OpenTelemetry.

## Architecture
SkyWalking is logically split into four parts: Probes, Platform backend, Storage and UI.

- **Probe**s collect data and reformat them for SkyWalking requirements (different probes support different sources).
- **Platform backend** supports data aggregation, analysis and streaming process covers traces, metrics, and logs.
- **Storage** houses SkyWalking data through an open/plugable interface. You can choose an existing implementation, such as
  ElasticSearch, H2, MySQL, TiDB, InfluxDB, or implement your own. Patches for new storage implementors welcome!
- **UI** is a highly customizable web based interface allowing SkyWalking end users to visualize and manage SkyWalking data.

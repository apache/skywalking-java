# K8s monitoring 
SkyWalking leverages K8s kube-state-metrics and cAdvisor for collecting metrics data from K8s, and leverages OpenTelemetry Collector to transfer the metrics to
[OpenTelemetry receiver](backend-receivers.md#opentelemetry-receiver) and into the [Meter System](./../../concepts-and-designs/meter.md). This feature requires authorizing the OAP Server to access K8s's `API Server`.  
We define the k8s-cluster as a `Service` in the OAP, and use `k8s-cluster::` as a prefix to identify it.  
We define the k8s-node as an `Instance` in the OAP, and set its name as the K8s `node name`.  
We define the k8s-service as an `Endpoint` in the OAP, and set its name as `$serviceName.$namespace`.  

## Data flow
1. K8s kube-state-metrics and cAdvisor collect metrics data from K8s.
2. OpenTelemetry Collector fetches metrics from kube-state-metrics and cAdvisor via Prometheus Receiver and pushes metrics to SkyWalking OAP Server via the OpenCensus GRPC Exporter.
3. The SkyWalking OAP Server access to K8s's `API Server` gets meta info and parses the expression with [MAL](../../concepts-and-designs/mal.md) to filter/calculate/aggregate and store the results. 

## Setup 
1. Setup [kube-state-metric](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics#kubernetes-deployment).
2. cAdvisor is integrated into `kubelet` by default.
3. Set up [OpenTelemetry Collector ](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/getting-started/#kubernetes). For details on Prometheus Receiver in OpenTelemetry Collector for K8s, refer to [here](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/documentation/examples/prometheus-kubernetes.yml). For a quick start, we have provided a full example for OpenTelemetry Collector configuration [otel-collector-config.yaml](otel-collector-config.yaml).
4. Config SkyWalking [OpenTelemetry receiver](backend-receivers.md#opentelemetry-receiver).

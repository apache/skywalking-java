# How to enable Kafka Reporter

The Kafka reporter plugin support report traces, JVM metrics, Instance Properties, and profiled snapshots to Kafka cluster, which is disabled in default. Move the jar of the plugin, `kafka-reporter-plugin-x.y.z.jar`, from `agent/optional-reporter-plugins` to `agent/plugins` for activating.

If you configure to use `compression.type` such as `lz4`, `zstd`, `snappy`, etc., you also need to move the jar of the plugin, `lz4-java-x.y.z.jar` or `zstd-jni-x.y.z.jar` or `snappy-java.x.y.z.jar`, from `agent/optional-reporter-plugins` to `agent/plugins`.

Notice, currently, the agent still needs to configure GRPC receiver for delivering the task of profiling. In other words, the following configure cannot be omitted.

```properties
# Backend service addresses.
collector.backend_service=${SW_AGENT_COLLECTOR_BACKEND_SERVICES:127.0.0.1:11800}

# Kafka producer configuration
plugin.kafka.bootstrap_servers=${SW_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS:localhost:9092}
plugin.kafka.producer_config[delivery.timeout.ms]=12000
plugin.kafka.get_topic_timeout=${SW_GET_TOPIC_TIMEOUT:10}
```

Kafka reporter plugin support to customize all configurations of listed in [here](http://kafka.apache.org/24/documentation.html#producerconfigs).

Before you activated the Kafka reporter, you have to make sure that [Kafka fetcher](../../backend/backend-fetcher.md#kafka-fetcher) has been opened in service.

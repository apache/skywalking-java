# Setup java agent
1. Agent is available for JDK 8 - 14 in 7.x releases. JDK 1.6 - JDK 12 are supported in all 6.x releases [NOTICE¹](#notice)
1. Find `agent` folder in SkyWalking release package
1. Set `agent.service_name` in `config/agent.config`. Could be any String in English.
1. Set `collector.backend_service` in `config/agent.config`. Default point to `127.0.0.1:11800`, only works for local backend.
1. Add `-javaagent:/path/to/skywalking-package/agent/skywalking-agent.jar` to JVM argument. And make sure to add it before the `-jar` argument.

The agent release dist is included in Apache [official release](http://skywalking.apache.org/downloads/). New agent package looks like this.
```

- Start your application.

## Supported middleware, framework and library
SkyWalking agent has supported various middlewares, frameworks and libraries.
Read [supported list](Supported-list.md) to get them and supported version.
If the plugin is in **Optional²** catalog, go to [optional plugins](#optional-plugins) section to learn how to active it.

## Advanced features
- All plugins are in `/plugins` folder. The plugin jar is active when it is in there. Remove the plugin jar, it disabled.
- The default logging output folder is `/logs`.

## Install javaagent FAQs
- Linux Tomcat 7, Tomcat 8, Tomcat 9  
Change the first line of `tomcat/bin/catalina.sh`.
```shell
CATALINA_OPTS="$CATALINA_OPTS -javaagent:/path/to/skywalking-agent/skywalking-agent.jar"; export CATALINA_OPTS
```

- Windows Tomcat 7, Tomcat 8, Tomcat 9  
Change the first line of `tomcat/bin/catalina.bat`.
```shell
set "CATALINA_OPTS=-javaagent:/path/to/skywalking-agent/skywalking-agent.jar"
```

- JAR file  
Add `-javaagent` argument to command line in which you start your app. eg:
 ```shell
 java -javaagent:/path/to/skywalking-agent/skywalking-agent.jar -jar yourApp.jar
 ```

- Jetty  
Modify `jetty.sh`, add `-javaagent` argument to command line in which you start your app. eg:
```shell
export JAVA_OPTIONS="${JAVA_OPTIONS} -javaagent:/path/to/skywalking-agent/skywalking-agent.jar"
```

## Dynamic Configurations
All configurations above are static, if you need to change some agent settings at runtime, please read [CDS - Configuration Discovery Service document](configuration-discovery.md) for more details.

## Optional Plugins
Java agent plugins are all pluggable. Optional plugins could be provided in `optional-plugins` folder under agent or 3rd party repositories.
For using these plugins, you need to put the target plugin jar file into `/plugins`.

Now, we have the following known optional plugins.
* [Plugin of tracing Spring annotation beans](agent-optional-plugins/Spring-annotation-plugin.md)
* [Plugin of tracing Oracle and Resin](agent-optional-plugins/Oracle-Resin-plugins.md)
* [Filter traces through specified endpoint name patterns](agent-optional-plugins/trace-ignore-plugin.md)
* Plugin of Gson serialization lib in optional plugin folder.
* Plugin of Zookeeper 3.4.x in optional plugin folder. The reason of being optional plugin is, many business irrelevant traces are generated, which cause extra payload to agents and backends. At the same time, those traces may be just heartbeat(s).
* [Customize enhance](Customize-enhance-trace.md) Trace methods based on description files, rather than write plugin or change source codes.
* Plugin of Spring Cloud Gateway 2.1.x in optional plugin folder. Please only active this plugin when you install agent in Spring Gateway. spring-cloud-gateway-2.x-plugin and spring-webflux-5.x-plugin are both required.
* Plugin of Spring Transaction in optional plugin folder. The reason of being optional plugin is, many local span are generated, which also spend more CPU, memory and network.
* [Plugin of Kotlin coroutine](agent-optional-plugins/Kotlin-Coroutine-plugin.md) provides the tracing across coroutines automatically. As it will add local spans to all across routines scenarios, Please assess the performance impact.
* Plugin of quartz-scheduler-2.x in the optional plugin folder. The reason for being an optional plugin is, many task scheduling systems are based on quartz-scheduler, this will cause duplicate tracing and link different sub-tasks as they share the same quartz level trigger, such as ElasticJob.
* Plugin of spring-webflux-5.x in the optional plugin folder. Please only activate this plugin when you use webflux alone as a web container. If you are using SpringMVC 5 or Spring Gateway, you don't need this plugin.

## Bootstrap class plugins
All bootstrap plugins are optional, due to unexpected risk. Bootstrap plugins are provided in `bootstrap-plugins` folder.
For using these plugins, you need to put the target plugin jar file into `/plugins`.

Now, we have the following known bootstrap plugins.
* Plugin of JDK HttpURLConnection. Agent is compatible with JDK 1.6+
* Plugin of JDK Callable and Runnable. Agent is compatible with JDK 1.6+

## The Logic Endpoint
In default, all the RPC server-side names as entry spans, such as RESTFul API path and gRPC service name, would be endpoints with metrics.
At the same time, SkyWalking introduces the logic endpoint concept, which allows plugins and users to add new endpoints without adding new spans.
The following logic endpoints are added automatically by plugins.
1. GraphQL Query and Mutation are logic endpoints by using the names of them.
1. Spring's ScheduledMethodRunnable jobs are logic endpoints. The name format is `SpringScheduled`/`${className}`/`${methodName}`.
1. Apache ShardingSphere ElasticJob's jobs are logic endpoints. The name format is `ElasticJob`/`${jobName}`.
1. XXLJob's jobs are logic endpoints. The name formats include `xxl-job`/`MethodJob`/`${className}`.`${methodName}`, `xxl-job`/`ScriptJob`/`${GlueType}`/`id`/`${jobId}`, and `xxl-job`/`SimpleJob`/`${className}`.
1. Quartz(optional plugin)'s jobs are logic endpoints. the name format is `quartz-scheduler`/`${className}`.

User could use the SkyWalking's application toolkits to add the tag into the local span to label the span as a logic endpoint in the analysis stage.
The tag is, key=`x-le` and value = `{"logic-span":true}`.

## Advanced Features
* Set the settings through system properties for config file override. Read [setting override](Setting-override.md).
* Use gRPC TLS to link backend. See [open TLS](TLS.md)
* Monitor a big cluster by different SkyWalking services. Use [Namespace](Namespace.md) to isolate the context propagation. 
* Set client [token](Token-auth.md) if backend open [token authentication](../../backend/backend-token-auth.md).
* Application Toolkit, are a collection of libraries, provided by SkyWalking APM. Using them, you have a bridge between your application and SkyWalking APM agent. 
    * If you want your codes to interact with SkyWalking agent, including `getting trace id`, `setting tags`, `propagating custom data` etc.. Try [SkyWalking manual APIs](Application-toolkit-trace.md).
    * If you require customized metrics, try [SkyWalking Meter System Toolkit](Application-toolkit-meter.md).
    * If you want to print trace context(e.g. traceId) in your logs, or collect logs, choose the log frameworks, [log4j](Application-toolkit-log4j-1.x.md), 
[log4j2](Application-toolkit-log4j-2.x.md), [logback](Application-toolkit-logback-1.x.md)
    * If you want to continue traces across thread manually, use [across thread solution APIs](Application-toolkit-trace-cross-thread.md).
    * If you want to forward MicroMeter/Spring Sleuth metrics to Meter System, use [SkyWalking MicroMeter Register](Application-toolkit-micrometer.md).
    * If you want to use OpenTracing Java APIs, try [SkyWalking OpenTracing compatible tracer](Opentracing.md). More details you could find at http://opentracing.io
    * If you want to tolerate some exceptions, read [tolerate custom exception doc](How-to-tolerate-exceptions.md).
* If you want to specify the path of your agent.config file. Read [set config file through system properties](Specified-agent-config.md)

## Advanced Reporters
The advanced report provides an alternative way to submit the agent collected data to the backend. All of them are in the `optional-reporter-plugins` folder, move the one you needed into the `reporter-plugins` folder for the activation. **Notice, don't try to activate multiple reporters, that could cause unexpected fatal errors.**

* Use Kafka to transport the traces, JVM metrics, instance properties, and profiled snapshots to the backend. Read the [How to enable Kafka Reporter](How-to-enable-kafka-reporter.md) for more details.

## Plugin Development Guide
SkyWalking java agent supports plugin to extend [the supported list](Supported-list.md). Please follow 
our [Plugin Development Guide](../../../guides/Java-Plugin-Development-Guide.md).

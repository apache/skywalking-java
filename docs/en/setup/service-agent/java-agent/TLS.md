# Support Transport Layer Security (TLS)
Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a very common security way when transport data through Internet.
In some use cases, end users report the background:

> Target(under monitoring) applications are in a region, which also named VPC,
at the same time, the SkyWalking backend is in another region (VPC).
> 
> Because of that, security requirement is very obvious.

## Authentication Mode
Only support **no mutual auth**.
- Use this [script](../../../../../tools/TLS/tls_key_generate.sh) if you are not familiar with how to generate key files.
- Find `ca.crt`, and use it at client side
- Find `server.crt` ,`server.pem` and `ca.crt`. Use them at server side. Please refer to `gRPC SSL` of the OAP server doc.
  for more details.

## Open and config TLS

### Agent config
- Place `ca.crt` into `/ca` folder in agent package. Notice, `/ca` is not created in distribution, please create it by yourself.

- Agent open TLS automatically after the `/ca/ca.crt` file detected.
- TLS with no CA mode could be activated by this setting.
```
agent.force_tls=${SW_AGENT_FORCE_TLS:false}
```
